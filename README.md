"sang", "sing", "song", and "sung" are *four* English words.

Is there a similar thing, but with *five* words? More specifically, is there a 5-tuple of words that only differ in a single vowel, and all of them are "valid" words?

Yes! Yes, there is. Many of them, in fact.

## German

Before running, simply change `WORDLIST_FILENAME` to the filename of the German wordlist. Here's a run with the wordlist in the Debian package `wngerman`:

```console
$ cargo run --release
- ladern, ledern, lidern, lodern, ludern
- lagen, legen, ligen, logen, lugen
- last, lest, list, lost, lust
- zacken, zecken, zicken, zocken, zucken
Found 4 matches, 60 close matches.
```

I like all four of these.

Notes:
- "ladern" is the plural dative of "Lader"
- "ligen" is the plural of "Liga"
- "lest" is the imperative form of "lesen"
- "list" is actually "List" (as in "listig, hinterh√§ltig")
- "zacken, zecken, zicken, zocken, zucken" is my favorite :-)

## TODOs and Contribute

Usually I would add some TODOs or a call for contributions here, but this really is just a "shits and giggles" program, so there's nothing to do, and nothing to contribute. Have fun! :)
